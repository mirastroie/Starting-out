       <p>
        We continue to live by our responsible 
        and caring value which means being consistent
         with our already high standards around hygiene, 
         sanitization and cleaning. 
         We have listed some of the extra steps 
         taken in addition to these rigorous routines
          to reflect the advice and guidance of the
           World Health Organization, 
           Centers for Disease Control and 
           Prevention (CDC) and local health 
           authorities on a country-by-country
            basis to ensure what we are doing is
             correct, comprehensive and effective.
       </p>
       <p> Public Spaces and Facilities:  Frequent sanitization of high touch 
           surfaces, high traffic areas such as receptions,
            welcome lounges and waiting areas, restaurants
             and related facilities, washrooms, libraries,
              boutiques, experience centers and meetings rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
        Food and Beverage: Strict delivery measures,
         enhanced training protocols, food handling 
         standards and sanitation guidelines, and a
          new service approach at restaurants and host
           cafes. Re-imagined minibars filled with healthy
            snacks and drinks based on each guest’s requirements
             prior to arrival, more out-of-the-ordinary private
              dining and destination options, improved in-villa
               dining and more live cooking stations at our
                restaurants - all appropriately spread out to
                 avoid crowding.
    </p>
    <p>
        Guest Rooms: Additional cleaning processes
         for daily housekeeping service during the 
         stay and after departure, and improved 
         protocols around handling guest items and laundry.
    </p>
       <p>
        Spas and Fitness Centers: Cleaning and sanitization of treatment rooms, facilities and all equipment between each appointment, wet facilities accessible via a prior appointment only, reduction or removal of high-touch items and additional deep cleaning of all surfaces as well as enhanced protocols around handling laundry.

            Given the ever-changing situation surrounding
             COVID-19 and travel restrictions many countries 
             may still have in place, we are keeping our
              cancellation policy under regular review to
               ensure you have the flexibility you need when
                considering your travel plans.
           </p>
           <p>Existing Bookings:
            If you have an existing booking at one of our Six Senses resorts globally, which you made before April 15, 2020, and you booked with us directly, you may change or cancel this booking without a cancellation fee for stays up to August 30, 2020.
            
            Please contact the resort directly with your reservation or itinerary confirmation number.
            
            We ask that for bookings made through a tour operator, travel agent or online booking platform, you contact them directly to discuss your reservation and refer to their terms and conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                New Bookings:
                We would like to help you plan and book your 
                next stay with confidence and we have several
                ways to support you by offering you more 
                flexibility to amend or cancel your booking.
                
                On new bookings from April 16, 2020 
                to December 21, 2020 the following 
                flexible cancellation and deposit policies apply:</p>
                <p>
                1) Free cancellations up to 24 hours prior to arrival: 
                
                Cancellations made less than 24 hours prior to arrival will result in one-night’s charge.</p>
               <p> 2) Free cancellation up to five days prior to arrival:
